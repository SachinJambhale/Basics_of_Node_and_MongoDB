// Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime 
// environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code 
// outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network 
// applications. 

// LTS - Long Term Support 

// even versions 
// 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18

// There are some limitations for the javascript if executed in the web browser
// like files operations are not allowed. 

// The network application(server) cannot be executed using web browsers  because 
// those apps needs to be running on a specifc port number to receive the requsts 

// You can overcome these limitations by executing javascript using nodejs 

// THe nodejs comes with some built in libraries(packages). 
// All the built packages are already installed along with nodejs


// THere are plenty of third party packages developed by individual developers 
// and companies. 
// You can use those third packages in your project. 

// Nodejs provides a tool called Node Package Manager (NPM) to install/update/uninstall 
// the third party packages. 


// 'yarn' is the advanced alternative to NPM 



// Nodejs Project:- 
// Any nodejs based project (Reactjs/Angular/server) requires a project 
// configuration file called 'package.json'

// To create the package.json file you can use 'npm init' command

// 'npm init -y' here -y represents all yes, to select default configuration 


// Learning Nodejs :- 
//   You need to lern the built in nodejs packages and some of the third party 
//   packages. 
//     - file operations 
//     - data base operations 
//     - http operations 
//     - etc.
